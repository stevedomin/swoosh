## Changelog

Swoosh has been very stable for a very long time. It's about time, v1.0 is here.

## BREAKING

- Fixed return value for `Sendmail` [#483](https://github.com/swoosh/swoosh/pull/483)
  - before the fix its `deliver` implementation returns `:ok` but the Mailer behaviour requires it to return `{:ok, something}`, now it returns `{:ok, %{}}`
